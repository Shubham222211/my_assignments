
In this portfolio, I present four diverse and compelling projects: Snapdeal, Search Movie, Employee Management, and BMI. Each project showcases my proficiency in front-end development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, RESTful APIs, and React. Here’s a detailed overview of each project:
1.	Snapdeal: This project simulates an e-commerce platform similar to Snapdeal, focusing on user experience and interface. The front end is built using HTML and CSS, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design. JavaScript powers the dynamic functionalities, such as interactive product listings and user authentication. Integrating a RESTful API allows for seamless data retrieval and updating, enhancing the shopping experience by displaying real-time product availability and user-specific recommendations. React is used to manage the application state efficiently, providing a smooth and scalable user interface.
2.	Search Movie: The Search Movie project is a web application that allows users to search for movies and view detailed information about them. Utilizing HTML and CSS for the basic structure and styling, this project employs JavaScript to handle user input and interactions. The core functionality is driven by a RESTful API, which fetches movie data from an external database. React is used to build a dynamic and responsive interface, where components like search bars, result lists, and movie detail views are seamlessly integrated. This project demonstrates my ability to work with third-party APIs and manage asynchronous data fetching in a React environment.
3.	Employee Management: This project is a comprehensive solution for managing employee records and operations within an organization. The application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Key features include adding, updating, and deleting employee records, as well as viewing detailed employee profiles. The RESTful API ensures efficient communication with the backend, enabling real-time updates and data integrity. React is utilized to manage complex state transitions and provide a responsive user experience. This project highlights my skills in CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and state management in React.
4.	BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator: The BMI Calculator is a straightforward but essential tool for calculating and assessing an individual’s body mass index. The interface is designed with HTML and CSS for simplicity and ease of use. JavaScript handles the logic behind the calculations, taking user input for height and weight and computing the BMI. The project also includes features to categorize the BMI result into various health categories. React is used to manage the form input and output dynamically, ensuring a responsive user experience. This project showcases my ability to implement mathematical logic and form handling in a web application.
Through these projects, I demonstrate a solid understanding of front-end development principles, including responsive design, user interaction, API integration, and state management in React. Each project serves as a testament to my ability to create functional, user-centric web applications that cater to various needs and scenarios.
